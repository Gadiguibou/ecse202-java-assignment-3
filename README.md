# ECSE 202 Assignment 3 (Java)

> Moving one step towards our final goal of building an implementation of the game of “Pong”, in this assignment you will tackle the intermediate problem of writing a simulation of a human player hitting a ping-pong ball against a wall.

This assignment had us improve our previous ping-pong simulation from assignment 2 with an asynchronous paddle object controlled with the mouse pointer. It updates the physics so that the speed of the paddle is reflected in the new speed of the ball after a collision.
